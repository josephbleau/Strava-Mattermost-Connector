# Strava Mattermost Connector

Integrate your Mattermost chat server with Strava. Under active development. 

You can start using it today by visiting: https://strava-mattermost-connector.herokuapp.com/

Be warned this application is under active development and so things may change or break! ðŸ˜Š

## Worklog (keeping track of what I've done each day)

* 3/8/2020
	* Refactored registration flow!
	* User can now provide their own mattermost details (it was being stored before, but provided automatically)
	* Added 'verified' field to the user details, removed the notion of storing user:code keys, only using user:athleteId now.
Using google static map api we're now displaying a preview of the route in the MM message!
* 3/7/2020
	* Installed Linux for Windows so I could run redis locally
	* Store mattermost configuration details for a user now instead of only their strava token, this will allow the app to accommodate multiple mattermost servers across multiple users
